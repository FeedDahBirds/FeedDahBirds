ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher Layton (@FeedDahBirds).

I'm working on being more consistent with my coding, and building out things that I enjoy!
I like to focus on math, science coding to build tools, simulations and whatever seems cool.

My goal is commit at least one piece of functional code a day for the next year. Wish me luck!
